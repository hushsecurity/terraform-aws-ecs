## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Terraform `>= 1.3`
- AWS CLI with valid credentials
- Existing ECS cluster (EC2 launch type)
- Existing EC2 instances registered to the cluster
- IAM permissions for ECS, IAM, and Secrets Manager

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Navigate to an example directory:

   ```bash
   cd examples/generated_secrets
   # OR
   cd examples/existing_secret
   ```

2. Define your credentials and configuration in `terraform.tfvars`, for example:

   ```hcl
   cluster_name = "my-ecs-cluster"

   # Container registry credentials  
   container_registry_username = "my-container-registry-username"
   container_registry_password = "my-container-registry-password"

   # Deployment credentials
   deployment_token    = "my-deployment-token"
   deployment_password = "my-deployment-password"

   # AWSVPC networking (required - private subnets only)
   vpc_private_subnets = [
     "subnet-xxxxxx",  # Private subnet A with NAT Gateway
     "subnet-yyyyyy",  # Private subnet B with NAT Gateway  
     "subnet-zzzzzz"   # Private subnet C with NAT Gateway
   ]
   
   # Option 1: Auto-create security group (recommended)
   vpc_id = "vpc-xxxxxxxxx"  # Auto-creates egress-only security group
   
   # Option 2: Use existing security groups (alternative to above)
   # security_groups = ["sg-xxxxxxxxx"]  # Must allow egress traffic
   ```

3. Initialize and apply:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

## üîê Secrets Management

This module supports **two modes** for injecting secrets into ECS tasks:

### 1. **Create and store via Terraform**
Set these values in `terraform.tfvars`:

- `deployment_token`
- `deployment_password`
- `container_registry_username`
- `container_registry_password`

Terraform will upload these to Secrets Manager and pass them securely to the ECS task.

### 2. **Use existing Secrets Manager ARNs**
Instead of secret values, use:

- `deployment_credentials_secret_arn`
- `container_registry_credentials_secret_arn`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- ECS DAEMON-style deployment (1 task per EC2 instance)
- Deploys both `sensor` and `sensor-vector` containers
- **Auto-upgrade capability via Vermon** (optional, enabled by default)
- **AWSVPC networking support** with dedicated ENI per task
- **Auto-created security groups** with egress-only access (optional)
- Supports private container registries (e.g. Azure Container Registry)
- Secure secrets injection via AWS Secrets Manager
- Configurable CPU/memory requests and limits

---

## üåê AWSVPC Networking

This module supports **AWSVPC networking mode** for enhanced network isolation and security.

### Key Features
- **Dedicated ENI per task** with individual IP addresses
- **Security group isolation** for fine-grained network controls  
- **VPC subnet placement** across multiple availability zones
- **Task role support** for AWS service integration

### Required Variables for AWSVPC

#### Option 1: Use Existing Security Groups
```hcl
vpc_private_subnets = [
  "subnet-xxxxxx",  # Private subnet A
  "subnet-yyyyyy",  # Private subnet B  
  "subnet-zzzzzz"   # Private subnet C
]

security_groups = ["sg-xxxxxxxxx"]  # Your existing security group
```

#### Option 2: Auto-Create Security Group
```hcl
vpc_private_subnets = [
  "subnet-xxxxxx",  # Private subnet A
  "subnet-yyyyyy",  # Private subnet B  
  "subnet-zzzzzz"   # Private subnet C
]

vpc_id = "vpc-xxxxxxxxx"  # Security group will be auto-created
# security_groups = []  # Optional: can be omitted for auto-creation
```

### Network Requirements
- **Private subnets** with NAT Gateway for internet access (public subnets not supported)
- **Security group** allowing all egress traffic for container registry and deployment reporting
- **Task role** with ENI management permissions (automatically configured)

### Security Group Management

When `vpc_id` is provided, the module automatically creates an egress-only security group allowing all outbound traffic for container registry access and deployment reporting.

When `security_groups` is provided, you must ensure it allows all egress traffic to `0.0.0.0/0`

#### Validation
The module validates that either `security_groups` or `vpc_id` is provided, but not both simultaneously.

### Why AWSVPC for Both Components?
- **Sensor**: Requires dedicated ENI for network isolation and security group controls
- **Vermon**: Benefits from consistent networking architecture and enhanced monitoring capabilities
- **Best Practice**: AWS recommends AWSVPC networking for all ECS tasks over bridge/host networking

---

## üîÑ Auto-Upgrade (Vermon)

The module includes optional **Vermon** component for automated container updates:

### Enable Vermon
```hcl
enable_vermon           = true
vermon_update_frequency = "8h"  # Check frequency
```

### How It Works
- Monitors ECS services for new container image versions
- Automatically triggers service updates when new images are available
- Uses channel digests to determine update availability
- Provides centralized upgrade management across multiple services
